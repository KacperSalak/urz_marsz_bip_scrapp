This project was created as a part of my master thesis. It is focused on analyzing polish OGD and public institutions' communication contents. The app implements Selenium library, Chrome browser and Chrome driver in order to extract text data from targeted institutions' wbesites. After each succesful run, the app dumps the result into a json file.
